Window to the World is a new form of AI that uses a novel architecture and detailed data storage to create a complex system that uses emergent intelligence to make decisions about any data the system can analyze. Window to the World takes a data stream, processes it through multiple models to create many different data points, then runs those data points against a series of Bayesian algorithms to create a preference engine. The result is an open system that is powerful and generalizable, able to make decisions about any form of data that it has the models to analyze.

## Introduction

Despite advances in scale and complexity in the AI industry, there have been almost no substantive changes for years. While transformers created improvements in some applications, they are not that different from neural networks. They are an incremental improvement rather than a shift in the paradigm. Window to the World represents that paradigm shift.

Rather than using a single model at a gigantic scale, like transformers or neural networks, Window to the World uses a modular approach that leverages multiple models at a smaller scale. Multiple data analysis models are used to analyze incoming data. Each data analysis module adds one or more data points to the data in the stream. These data points (or "tags") are analyzed by a predictive model based on previous data. The predictive model adds prediction tags to the stream, which is validated by user action. That validation is fed back into the predictive model to improve its accuracy.

Window to the World is unique in several ways. First is its input: it is data-agnostic, meaning that it is not limited to any particular data type. It can take any form of data, as long as it can analyze that data well enough to create data points. The second is its output: it is a preference engine, meaning that it is designed to make a choice. As with the data type, it can choose anything, as long as it has enough data. The third is that it is modular. It can be expanded to the needs of the application. If more or different models are needed, they can be added or changed on the fly. Finally, it is an entirely open system. Unlike some systems, Window to the World's inner workings are visible throughout the entire process. The only black boxes here are the individual modules themselves, but all they do is provide individual data points. What Window to the World does with them can be monitored from start to finish.

## Theory

The theory behind Window to the World is detailed but can be broken down into two main parts: consciousness and preference.

## Practice

In practical terms, Window to the World's abilities are based on its architecture and data storage. Window to the World is also an open-box system.
