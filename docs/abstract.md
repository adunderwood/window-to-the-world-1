Abstract

Dorothy is a new form of AI that uses a novel architecture and detailed data storage to create a complex system that uses emergent intelligence to make decisions about any data the system can analyze. Dorothy takes a data stream, processes it through multiple models to create many different data points, then runs those data points against a series of Bayesian algorithms to create a preference engine. The result is an open system that is powerful and generalizable, able to make decisions about any form of data that it has the models to analyze.
