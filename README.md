# Window to the World
A product by Ice 9 Innovations

Window to the World is a window that watches you. It learns your preferences and shows you what you want to see. It gives you more of what you like and less of what you donâ€™t.

Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' short stories, The Aleph and The Garden of Forking Paths, Window to the World is a preference engine as described by Alan Turing in a note addressed to Lady Ada Lovelace in his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence. 

Window to the World is available as a public preview release here:
